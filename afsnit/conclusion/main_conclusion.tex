The control engineering theory:
??
FreeRTOS:

The controller is implemented on the Tiva as a task with the highest possible priority to make sure it has the best timing possible for the system. It has been chosen to use FreeRTOS as the Tiva's operating system, because it can handle more than one task as well as offering preemptive scheduling.
Encoder:

The controller needs a position in order to calculate the PWM values for the pan-tilt system. For this purpose Quadrature Encoders, mounted on the motors, are used.
As the FPGA handles all direct contact with the pan-tilt system, a Quadrature Decoder program has been designed and written to decode the encoders' signals into a position.
It can detect the position with a $\frac{1}{3}$ degrees precision and direction as well as the velocity of which the system is rotating.
