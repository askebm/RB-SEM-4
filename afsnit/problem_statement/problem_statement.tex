The overarching aim of the project is to create a platform for a stage spotlight with the behavior expected of such a system in regards to movement characteristics.

As the mechanical platform is delivered to the project \todo{As the mechnical platform is provided for the project}, the main challenges arise from the theoretical system, control design and software engineering required to materialize the platform.

These challenges include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the performance requirements for a spotlight?
    \item What ways are there to control a system of this type? \todo{In what ways can a system of this type be controlled?}
    \item How can the chosen control engineering approach be implemented on a microcontroller? \todo{lyder en smule fordansket}
    \item How can one design a system allowing hardware control of the given platform? \todo{How can a system allowing hardware control of the given platform be designed?}
\end{itemize}

In order to provide a satisfactory answer to the above questions, the design of the FPGA modules and microcontroller software alongside with the considerations revolving around control engineering will be covered in the following report. \todo{Lyder lidt knudret. }
In order to provide a satisfactory answer to the above questions,
