Literature is kept in a list at the end of the report, and is referred to by hard brackets[number].
Journals can be found in appendix, and are referenced to as a normal section and subsection reference.
Equations are referenced to by parentheses(eq. number).

Lastly the PDF is interactive, meaning that clicking on references and chapters will jump to the list of literature or the chapter respectively.
