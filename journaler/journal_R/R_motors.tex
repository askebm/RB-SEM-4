\paragraph{Abstract}
The ohmic resistance of the two motors controlling the pan-tilt system is determined.
\paragraph{Introduction}
The goal of this journal is to determine the ohmic resistance of the two motors. Every constant concerning the motor of the top frame is denoted $A_t$ and the constants for the buttom frame is denoted $A_b$.
\paragraph{Materials and Methods}
To determine the ohmic resistance of the motors a known voltage will be applied, causing a current to flow through the motor. Using Ohm's law we can this determine the desired resistance.\\
The circuit used to determine the resistance of the motors can be seen on figure \ref{fig:resistance_circuit}. When executing the experiment a $VCC$ of $12V$ is chosen with a ohmic resistor with resistance $R_1 = 22\Omega$. Measuring the current flowing through the resistor in series with the motor on the top frame, it is seen that $I_t \approx 0.449 A$.

The same procedure is follwed for the bottom frame yielding a current measured to be $I_b \approx 0.448 A$. Thus the resistance of the two motors can be caluclated as:
$$VCC = (R_1 + R_{motor,t})\cdot I_t \Rightarrow R_{motor,t} = \frac{12V}{0.448 A}-22\Omega \approx 4.79 \Omega $$
$$VCC = (R_1 + R_{motor,b})\cdot I_b \Rightarrow R_{motor,b} = \frac{12V}{0.449 A}-22\Omega \approx 4.70 \Omega $$


\paragraph{Results}

The result of this experiment is:
$$R_{motor,b} \approx 4.70 \Omega$$
$$R_{motor,t} \approx 4.79 \Omega$$



\paragraph{Conclusion}

The resistance of the motor controlling the top frame is $R_{motor,t}\approx 4.79 \Omega$ and the resistance of the motor controlling the buttom frame is $R_{motor,b}\approx 4.70 \Omega$.
