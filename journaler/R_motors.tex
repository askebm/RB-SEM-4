\section{Abstract}
The ohmic resistance of the two motors controlling the pan-tilt system gets determined.
\section{Introduction}
The ohmic ressitance of the motors are the goal to be determined in this jounal.
\section{Materials and Methods}
To determine the ohmic resistance of the motors a known voltage will be applied, causing a current to flow through the motor. Using Ohm's law we thus can determine the wanted resistance.
