\section*{Current Sensor}

\subsection*{Considerations}

The current sensor system needs to provide individual measurements for each individual motor on the pan-tilt system.

Each driver board can control two motor with a singular supply input which mean that current for each individual motor can only be messured at the PWM output as the input wourd yield the combined current of both motors.



\subsection*{FPGA sense circuit}

The Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA has an ADC range of 0V-1V therefore the current sense shunt resistor need to by matched with the expected current draw by the system.

Each motor has a load current of 530 mA and a stall current of 2,5 A
Assuming each motor is monitored separately this means that the needed resistance providing a 20\% margin is
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    R&=\frac{U}{I}\\
    R&=\frac{1V}{0.530A\cdot1.20} \\
    R&=\frac{1V}{0.636A} \\
    R&=1,57\Omega
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}

This of course courses a 1V drop from supply voltage witch is not acceptable.

If a $0.1\Omega$ resistor is used the resulting voltage drop is $0.636A\cdot0.1\Omega = 0.0636V$

This can be amplified using a rail to rail opamp with a gain of

$$
A = \frac{1V}{0.636V} = 15.72
$$

The FPGA is capaple of samplelig at least 12.5 MHz. therefore it shourd be possible to messure the current on the PWM side of the motor driver.
