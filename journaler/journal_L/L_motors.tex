\paragraph{Abstract}

The inductance of the two motors controlling the pan-tilt system gets determined.

\paragraph{Introduction}

The electrical inductance of the motors are gets determined in this jounal. Every constant concerning the motor of the topframe is denoted $A_t$ while constants for the buttom frame is denoted $A_b$.

\paragraph{Materials and Methods}

To determien the electrical inductance of the two motors, the timeconstant method is used.\\
firstly the motor, illustrated as a coil, is linked in series with a resistor and s PWM controlled MOSFET. This can be seen on figure (\ref{fig:inductance_circuit}). By rapidly switching the MOSFET on and off the coil inside the motor will be charged and discarged along with current flowing through the resistor. This will cause a wave pattern to show the voltage across the coil. Using an oscilloscope the time from the wave starting to the top of the wave is given as:
$$\tau = \frac{L}{R}$$

By apllying this method the timeconstant is determined to be $\tau = 17.5 \cdot 10^{-6}s$. Thus the inductance with a resistor of size $22\Omega$ gets determined to be.\\
$$L = 17.5 \cdot 10^{-6}s \cdot 22 \Omega = 3.85 \cdot 10^{-4}H$$
The timeconstant was measured to be approximitly equal, and this therefore the case that the following is true:\\
$$L_b=L_t=3.85 \cdot 10^{-4}H$$

\paragraph{Results}

The result of this experiment is as follows.
$$L_b = 3.85 \cdot 10^{-4}H$$
$$L_t = 3.85 \cdot 10^{-4}H$$

\paragraph{Conclusion}

The electrical inductance of the motor controlling the top frame is $L_t= 3.85 \cdot 10^{-4}H$ and the resistance of the motor controlling the buttom frame is $L_b= 3.85 \cdot 10^{-4}H$.
